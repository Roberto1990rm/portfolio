    'project1_title' => 'Cervelab.es',
    'project1_description' => "In this project, I developed a catalog/aggregator for breweries and beers, a perfect tool for beer enthusiasts. My focus was on creating an interactive and user-friendly platform where registered users can add new breweries and beers to the catalog. To enhance the user experience, I integrated an interactive map with Leaflet, displaying each bar's location based on coordinates provided during entry creation. This feature adds significant value by enabling users to easily locate breweries of interest.

    On the homepage, I implemented an interactive beer counter that increases with each additional beer click, adding a fun and engaging element to the site. This feature not only improves interactivity but also creates a more enjoyable and entertaining atmosphere for site visitors.
    
    Additionally, the project features a robust content management system that allows users to create, edit, and delete entries simply and efficiently. This flexibility facilitates constant updating and expansion of the brewery and beer catalog.
    
    The project also excels in its sophisticated handling of table relationships in the database, allowing for logical and efficient organization of information about breweries and beers. This data structuring is crucial for maintaining the integrity and accuracy of the information presented on the site.
    
    In summary, this project demonstrates my ability to develop complete and appealing web applications, combining interactive front-end with advanced back-end functionalities. The amalgamation of interactive maps, playful counters, and a solid content management system makes this brewery and beer catalog/aggregator an indispensable tool for beer aficionados and explorers of the beer world.",
